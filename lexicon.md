## acceptable level of risk: 
Typically refers to the point at which the level of risk is more acceptable than the cost to mitigate the risk (in dollars or effect on building mission function).

access: (1) The technical ability to do something with a computer resource. This usually refers to ability to read, create, modify, or delete a file; execute a program; or use an external connection, admission, or entrance. (2) The ability or opportunity to obtain sensitive or classified information.

access control: The limiting of access to the resources of an IT (information technology) system only to authorized users, programs, processes, or other IT systems.

active security testing: Security testing that involves direct interaction with a target, such as sending packets to a target.

adequate security: Security commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to, or modification of information. This includes assuring that systems and applications used by owner operate effectively and provide appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability through the use of cost-effective management, personnel, operational, and technical controls. 

Advanced Persistent Threats (APT): An adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources that allow it to create opportunities to achieve its objectives by using multiple attack vectors (e.g., cyber, physical, and deception). These objectives typically include establishing and extending footholds within the information technology infrastructure of the targeted organizations for purposes of exfiltrating information, undermining or impeding critical aspects of a mission, program, or organization; or positioning itself to carry out these objectives in the future. The advanced persistent threat (1) pursues its objectives repeatedly over an extended period of time; (2) adapts to defenders’ efforts to resist it; and
(3) is determined to maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its objectives. An unauthorized person gains undetected access to a system and stays for a long period of time. The intent is to steal data. A persistent presence is sometimes called consolidation. APTs can wait a long time before becoming active. By performing a gap analysis of the network configuration, hidden APTs can be made to show themselves
either by detection methods or making them become visible by exposing themselves through their designed behavior.

advisory: Notification of significant new trends or developments regarding the threat to the information systems of an organization. This notification may include analytical insights into trends, intentions, technologies, or tactics of an adversary targeting information systems.

air gap: One or more computers are physically isolated from unsecured computer networks, such as
the public Internet or an unsecured local area network for security purposes. Air gap computers are not connected by wire or wirelessly, and (generally) cannot communicate directly with each other.

antispyware software: A program that specializes in detecting both malware and non-malware forms of spyware.

antivirus software: A program that monitors a computer or network to identify all major types of malware and prevent or contain malware incidents.

artifact: The digital remnants of a cyber-attack or incident activity. These could be software that was used by a hacker, a collection of tools, malicious code, logs, files, output from tools, or status of a building control system after a cyber-attack. Examples range from Trojan-horse programs and computer viruses to programs that exploit vulnerabilities or objects of unknown type and purpose found on a compromised computer.

assessment findings: Assessment results produced by the application of an assessment procedure to a security control or control enhancement to achieve an assessment objective; the execution of a determination statement within an assessment procedure by an assessor that results in either a satisfied or other than satisfied condition.

baseline: A minimum starting point used for comparisons. Hardware, software, databases, and relevant documentation for an information system at a given point in time.

baseline configuration: A set of specifications for a system, or configuration item (CI) within a system, that has been formally reviewed and agreed on at a given point in time, and which can be changed only through change control procedures. The baseline configuration is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes.

Blue Team: The group responsible for defending an enterprise’s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers (i.e., the Red Team). Typically, the Blue Team and
its supporters must defend against real or simulated attacks (1) over a significant period of time, (2) in
a representative operational context (e.g., as part of an operational exercise), and (3) according to rules established and monitored with the help of a neutral group refereeing the simulation or exercise (i.e., the White Team).

boundary protection: Monitoring and control of communications at the external boundary of an information system to prevent and detect malicious and other unauthorized communication, through the use of boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, encrypted tunnels). 

checklist test: A method used to ensure accuracy of information in a disaster recovery plan and that it is current.

cloud computing: A model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable IT capabilities/ resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned, and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. It allows users to access technology-based services from the network cloud without knowledge of, expertise with, or control over the technology infrastructure that supports them. This cloud model is composed of five
essential characteristics (on-demand self-service, ubiquitous network access, location independent resource
pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service); three service delivery models (Cloud Software as a Service [SaaS], Cloud Platform as a Service [PaaS], and Cloud Infrastructure as a Service [IaaS]); and four models for enterprise access (private cloud, community cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud).

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): A dictionary of common names for publicly known information system vulnerabilities.

Computer Network Defense Analysis: In cybersecurity work, a person that uses defensive measures and information collected from a variety of sources to identify, analyze, and report events that occur or might occur within the network in order to protect information, building control systems, and networks from threats.  SOURCE: NICCS

Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT): A capability set up for the purpose of assisting in responding to computer security-related incidents; also called a Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) or a CIRC (Computer Incident Response Center, Computer Incident Response Capability). This is a team providing services to a defined constituency. There are several acronyms used to describe teams providing similar types of services (e.g., CSIRC, CSRC, CIRC, CIRT, IHT, IRC, IRT, SERT, and SIRT). The generic term “CSIRT” has been widely adopted in the computer security community.

configuration management (CM): The management of changes made to a building control system’s hardware, software, firmware, documentation, tests, test fixtures, and test documentation throughout the operational life of the building.

contingency plan: A plan for emergency response, back-up operations, and post- cyber-attack recovery for building control systems and installations. The contingency plan ensures minimal impact upon building operations in the event the building control system or facility is damaged or destroyed.

Continuity of Operations (COOP): A predetermined set of instructions or procedures that describe how an organization’s mission-essential functions will be sustained within 12 hours and for up to 30 days as a result of a disaster event before returning to normal operations.

countermeasure: Any action, device, procedure, technique, or other measure that reduces the vulnerability of, or threat to a building control system. Reactive methods used to prevent an exploit from successfully occurring once a threat has been detected. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) commonly employ countermeasures to prevent intruders form gaining further access to a computer network. Other countermeasures are patches, access control lists and malware filters.
• 	Defensive countermeasures include actions to identify the source of hostile cyber activities protection/mitigation at the boundary (e.g., intrusion protection systems, preemptive blocks, blacklisting); hunting within networks (actively searching
for insiders and other adversaries or malware); passive and active intelligence (including law enforcement) employed to detect cyber threats; and/or actions to temporarily isolate a system engaged in hostile cyber activities.

• 	Offensive countermeasures might include electronic jamming or other negation measures intended to disrupt an adversary’s cyber capabilities during employment.

crisis management: The coordination of an organization’s response to a cyber-attack, in an effective, timely manner, with the goal of avoiding or minimizing damage to the building controls system’s ability to operate.

critical functions: Building activities or operations that cannot be interrupted or made unavailable for an extended period of time without significantly jeopardizing the mission of the organization.

critical infrastructure: System and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.

cyber campaign: Denotes the time during which a given cyber force conducts a series of planned and coordinated cyber-attacks or other cyber operations in a given network environment (sometimes referred to as the NEO, or network environment of operation). A cyber campaign may be executed by a single actor or as a combined effort of multiple actors. A cyber campaign is a series of related cyber operations aimed toward a single, specific, strategic objective or result. A cyber campaign may take place over the course of just a few days or weeks, or it can last several months or even years.

cyber-collection: Refers to the use of cyber-warfare techniques in order to conduct espionage. Cyber- collection activities typically rely on the insertion of malware into a targeted network or computer in order to scan for, collect, and infiltrate sensitive information. Cyber-collection started as far back as 1996, when widespread deployment of Internet connectivity to government and corporate systems gained momentum. Since that time, there have been numerous cases of such activity. In addition to the state-sponsored examples, cyber-collection has also been used by organized crime for identity and e-banking theft and by corporate spies.

Common functionality of cyber-collection systems includes the following:

• 	Data scan: local and network storage are scanned to find and copy files of interest, these are often documents, spreadsheets, design files such as AutoCAD files and system files such as the password file.
• 	Capture location: GPS, Wi-Fi, network information and other attached sensors are used to determine the location and movement of the infiltrated device.
• 	Bug: the device microphone can be activated in order to record audio. Likewise, audio streams intended for the local speakers can be intercepted at the device level and recorded.
• 	Hidden Private Networks that bypass the corporate network security. A computer that is being spied upon can be plugged into a legitimate corporate network that is heavy monitored for malware activity and at same time belongs to a private Wi-Fi network outside of the company network that is leaking confidential information off of an employee’s computer. A computer like this is easily set up by a double-agent working in the IT department by install a second Wireless card in a computer and special software to remotely monitor an employee’s computer through this second interface card without them being aware of a side-band communication channel pulling information off of his computer.

cyber-exercise: A planned event during which an organization simulates a cyber-attack to test capabilities such as preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to or recovering from the cyber-attack.

cyber-incident: Actions taken through the use of computer networks that result in an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system and/or the information residing therein. The difference between a cyber-incident and a cyber-event is that you are obligated to report a cyber-incident because it is now a law enforcement issue. A cyber-event merely raises the suspicion that an incident may be occurring.

cyber-infiltration: There are several common ways to infect or access the target:

• 	An injection proxy is a system that is placed upstream from the target individual or company, usually at the Internet Service Provider, that injects malware into the targets system. For example, an innocent download made by the user can be injected with the malware executable on the fly so that the target system then is accessible to hackers.
• 	spear phishing: A carefully crafted e-mail is sent to the target in order to entice them to install the malware via a Trojan document or a drive by attack hosted on a web server compromised or controlled by the malware owner.
• 	Surreptitious entry may be used to infect a system. In other words, the spies carefully break into the target’s office and install the malware on the target’s system.
• 	An upstream monitor or sniffer is a device that can intercept and view the data transmitted by a target system. Usually this device is placed at the Internet Service Provider. The Carnivore system is a famous example of this type of system. Based on the same logic as a telephone intercept, this type of system is of limited use today due to the widespread use of encryption during data transmission.
• 	A wireless infiltration system can be used in proximity of the target when the target is using wireless technology. This is usually a laptop-based system that impersonates a Wi-Fi or 3G base station to capture the target systems and relay requests upstream to the Internet. Once the target systems are on the network, the system then.
functions as an injection proxy or as an upstream monitor in order to infiltrate or monitor the target system.
• 	A USB Key preloaded with the malware infector may be given to or dropped at the target site.

cyber response plan: Provides guidance to prepare for and respond to a cyber-incident regardless of source. The document also suggests ways to learn from incidents and to strengthen the system against potential attacks. Provides written instructions on assembling an Incidence Response Team, assigning duties and responsibilities and method for documenting the nature and scope of a cyber-physical attack.

cyber tools:
• 	commodity capability: Cyber tools and techniques openly available on the Internet (off-the-shelf) that are relatively simple to use. This includes tools designed for security specialists (such as building control system penetration testers) that can
also be used by attackers as they are specifically designed to scan for publicly known vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications. Poison Ivy is a good example
of a commodity tool; it is a readily available Remote Access Tool (RAT) that has been widely used for a number of years.
• 	bespoke capability: Cyber tools and techniques that are developed and used for specific purposes, and thus require more specialist knowledge. This could include malicious code (‘exploits’) that take advantage of software vulnerabilities (or bugs) that are not yet known to vendors or anti-malware companies, often known as
zero-day exploits. It could also include undocumented software features, or poorly designed applications. Bespoke capabilities usually become commodity capabilities once their use has been discovered, sometimes within a few days. By their very nature, the availability of bespoke tools is not advertised as once released they become a commodity.

database: A repository of digital information that holds building or plant-wide information including manufacturing process data, personnel data, and financial data.

data breach: The unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information to a party that is not authorized to have the information.

data integrity: The property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner. Data integrity covers data in storage, during processing, and while in transit. 

Day Zero: The Day Zero or Zero Day is the day a new vulnerability is made known. In some cases, a “zero- day exploit” is referred to an exploit for which no patch is available yet. (“day one” > day at which the patch is made available).

demilitarized zone (DMZ): An interface on a routing firewall that is similar to the interfaces found on the firewall’s protected side. Traffic moving between the DMZ and other interfaces on the protected side of the firewall still goes through the firewall and can have firewall protection policies applied.

due care: The responsibility that manages and their organizations have a duty to provide for information security to ensure that the type of control, the cost of control, and the deployment of control are appropriate for the system being managed. A legal concept distinct from due diligence. “Did the company know of the vulnerability and the damage it could cause (including injury)?”

due diligence: The requirement that an organization deploy protection to prevent a cyber-attack from occurring. A legal concept distinct from due care. “Did the company do anything to prevent the damage the vulnerability could cause (including injury)?”

full-disk encryption (FDE): The process of encrypting all the data on the hard disk drive used to boot a computer, including the computer’s operating system, and permitting access to the data only after successful authentication with the full disk encryption product.

Internet of Things (IoT): The network of physical objects or “things” embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable devices to exchange data with other connected devices. The down side to all this is that the IoT can become a cheap tool for remote surveillance and reconnaissance and a great deal of information can be learned from device usage behavior. By aggregating this surveillance information about your building over time, an attacker could get a very accurate understanding of your building operations.

kill chain: Kill chain analysis illustrates the sequence of stages that the hacker must progress through successfully before achieving the desired objective; just one mitigation can disrupt the chain and stop the cyber-attack. The stages are: reconnaissance and staging, delivery and attack, exploitation and installation, system compromise. A kill chain analysis describes the very structure of a cyber-intrusion and the corresponding model guides analysis to inform actionable cyber security intelligence. Through this model, defenders can develop resilient mitigations against intruders and prioritize investments in new defensive technology or processes.

penetration test (pentest): A test methodology in which assessors, using all available documentation (e.g., system design, source code, manuals) and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent the security features of an information system. Security testing in which evaluators mimic real-world attacks in an attempt to identify ways to circumvent the security features of an application, system, or network. Penetration testing often involves issuing real attacks on real systems and data, using the same tools and techniques used by actual attackers. Most penetration tests involve looking for combinations of vulnerabilities on a single system or multiple systems that can be used to gain more access than could be achieved through a single vulnerability. The tools used for pen-testing can be classified into two kinds—scanners and attackers. Some software/tools will show you the weak spots, some that show and attack. 

phishing attack: Tricking individuals into disclosing sensitive personal information by claiming to be a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication (e.g., Internet web sites). A digital form of social engineering that uses authentic-looking—but bogus—e-mails to request information from users or direct them to a fake web site that requests information.

risk assessment: The process of identifying risks to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals by determining the probability of occurrence, the resulting impact, and additional security controls that would mitigate this impact. Part of risk management, synonymous with risk analysis. Incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses.

rogue access point: A rogue access point is a wireless access point that has been installed on a secure network without explicit authorization from a local network administrator, whether added by a well- meaning employee or by a malicious insider. Although it is technically easy for a well-meaning employee to install a “soft access point” or an inexpensive wireless router: perhaps to make access from mobile devices easier: it is likely that they will configure this as “open,” or with poor security, and potentially allow access
to unauthorized parties. If an attacker installs a rogue access point they are able to run various types of vulnerability scanners, and rather than having to be physically inside the building, a hacker can attack remotely: perhaps from a reception area, adjacent building, or car parking lot.

test & evaluation: In cybersecurity work, a person that develops and conducts tests of building control systems to evaluate compliance with specifications and requirements by applying principles and methods for cost-effective planning, evaluating, verifying, and validating of technical, functional, and performance characteristics (including interoperability) of building control systems or elements of building control systems incorporating information technology.

threat monitoring: Analysis, assessment, and review of audit trails and other information collected for the purpose of searching out building control system events that may constitute violations of building control system security.

untrusted process: Process that has not been evaluated or examined for correctness and adherence to the security policy. It may include incorrect or malicious code that attempts to circumvent the security mechanisms.

vishing attack: A type of phishing attack that uses a telephone (“v” is for voice) to obtain personal information. Phishing target is called directly by criminals or receives an e-mail asking the target to call a specific phone number.

vulnerability: A weakness in a building control system or component (e.g., security procedures,
hardware design, and internal controls) that could be exploited or attacked, or fail. Vulnerabilities include susceptibility to physical dangers, such as fire or water, unauthorized access to sensitive data, entry of erroneous data, denial of timely service, fraud, and so forth.

vulnerability assessment: Formal description and evaluation of the vulnerabilities in an information system. Systematic examination of an information system or product to determine the adequacy of security measures, identify security deficiencies, provide data from which to predict the effectiveness of proposed security measures, and confirm the adequacy of such measures after implementation.
1.	White-Box Test Team: Test team has complete and unrestricted access on site to the target network including network diagrams, hardware, operating system and application details. Knowledge of network allows the team to target specific building equipment, applications and field devices.

2.	Grey-Box Test Team: Test team simulates attack by a disgruntled employee on site. Test team has user-level privileges and access permitted to the target network with certain security policies relaxed.
3.	Black-Box Test Team: Test team has no prior knowledge of the target network (except possibly a web site URL or IP address). Test team attempts to break into the target network remotely.

vulnerability assessment & management: In cybersecurity work, a person that conducts assessments of threats and vulnerabilities, determines deviations from acceptable configurations, enterprise or local policy, assesses the level of risk, and develops and/or recommends appropriate mitigation countermeasures in operational and non-operational situations.

vulnerability stockpiling: The concept that rather than disclosing vulnerabilities to software makers so that they can be patched, a government might buy and then stockpile zero-days for possible use as an offensive weapon.

vulnerability testing: The intent of vulnerability testing is to identify potential problems with a building controls system. There are at least five types of vulnerability tests. Tests are conducted monthly, quarterly, or annually.

•      external vulnerability scan: Identify network-facing vulnerabilities (monthly).
•      internal vulnerability scan: Identify network-facing vulnerabilities (quarterly).
• 	external vulnerability assessment: Identify configuration and architecture vulnerabilities (annual).
• 	internal vulnerability assessment: Identify network, client, configuration and physical vulnerabilities (annual).
•      penetration test: Exploit any vulnerability to obtain access to building controls
(annual).

zero-day exploit attack: A worm, virus, or other cyber-threat that hits users on the same day the vulnerability is announced.
